### TodoMVC example using re-html-template

TodoMVC implemented with server side rendering and reagent UI with hydration to showcase re-html-template.

The backend uses [hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) to generate HTML from the template.
The frontend uses [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) and [tuck](https://github.com/tatut/tuck).

To run start both the backend and figwheel using commands: `lein run` and `lein figwheel dev`.
